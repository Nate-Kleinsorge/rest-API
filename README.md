## Description: 
I wanted to get back into coding after a while and I figured what's a better way than making a website for my uncle who is an artist.
I Built this to provide a website as a space to help people find Art and be able to ask Questions about it all around the country. while also allowing my Uncle to pursue his passion and find people who love his art.
This application solves the problem of the user not having a place to share his art
I learned that local API is a good way to navigate a small amount of information while also being easy to connect to the front end of the application.
